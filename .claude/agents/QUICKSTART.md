# Car Audio Events Agents - Quick Start Guide

## üöÄ Quick Reference

**Main Documentation**: `.claude/agents/CAR_AUDIO_EVENTS_AGENTS.md`
**Agent Directory**: `.claude/agents/`
**Project Config**: `CLAUDE.md` (mentions agent system)

## üéØ How to Call Agents

### 1. Automatic Activation (Recommended)
Agents activate automatically based on what you're working on:

```bash
# Navigate to a module and the relevant agent activates
cd src/modules/support-desk/
# Support Desk Specialist is now active

cd supabase/functions/create-payment-intent/
# Payment Integration Specialist is now active
```

### 2. Explicit Agent Request
Ask for specific agents by name:

```
"I need the rapid-prototyper agent to help me build a new dashboard"
"Get the backend-architect to review our API structure"
"I want the support desk specialist to optimize our ticket routing"
```

### 3. Multi-Agent Collaboration
Combine agents for complex features:

```
"I need the payment integration specialist and support desk specialist to work together on designing the refund workflow"

"Get the event platform architect, frontend developer, and backend architect to collaborate on building a real-time scoring system"
```
