- **Consistent, professional responses** tailored to your platform
- **Industry-specific content** for car audio events
- **No additional costs** during development and testing

### ðŸš€ Production Upgrade Path
For production deployment with real AI capabilities:

1. **Backend API Setup** (recommended)
2. **OpenAI API Integration**
3. **Secure API Key Management**
4. **User Authentication & Rate Limiting**

## Technical Details

### Files Added/Modified
- `src/components/AIWritingAssistant.tsx` - Main chat interface component
- `src/lib/openai.ts` - AI content generation utilities
- `src/api/ai.ts` - API endpoint structure for backend integration
- `src/pages/CMSPages.tsx` - Integration with CMS system

### Security Considerations
- **API Keys**: Never expose OpenAI API keys in frontend code
- **Authentication**: Ensure only authorized users can access AI features
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement usage limits to control costs
- **Content Filtering**: Add content moderation for generated text

## Backend Integration (Optional)

To enable real OpenAI API integration, you'll need to:

### 1. Set up Backend Endpoint
```javascript
// Example Node.js/Express implementation
app.post('/api/ai/generate', authenticateUser, async (req, res) => {
  const { message, pageType, currentContent } = req.body;
  
  const openai = new OpenAI({
    apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY
  });

  const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: "gpt-4",
    messages: [
      { 
        role: "system", 
        content: "You are a professional content writer for car audio events..." 
      },
      { role: "user", content: message }
    ],
    max_tokens: 1500,
    temperature: 0.7
  });

  res.json({
    success: true,
    content: completion.choices[0]?.message?.content || ''
  });
});
```

### 2. Environment Variables
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

### 3. Update Frontend Configuration
Modify `src/lib/openai.ts` to use the real API endpoint instead of simulation.
