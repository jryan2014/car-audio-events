## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Support Desk Fixes

- **Ticket Filtering**: Fixed "no tickets found" issue and assignment dropdown errors

### 2. AI Agent System Integration
- **Repository**: Integrated Contains Studio Agents (https://github.com/contains-studio/agents)

- **Custom Agents**: Added Car Audio Events specific agents:
  - Support Desk Specialist
  - Event Platform Architect
  - Payment Integration Specialist
  - Master Project Manager
- **Documentation**: Created comprehensive guides:
  - PROJECT_ORCHESTRATION.md - Master PM usage guide
  - QUICKSTART.md - Multi-agent collaboration examples
  - AGENT_CHEATSHEET.md - Quick reference templates
  - CAR_AUDIO_EVENTS_AGENTS.md - Full agent documentation

## Files Modified

### Support Desk Components
- `src/modules/support-desk/components/user/TicketDetail.tsx` - Fixed breadcrumb
- `src/modules/support-desk/components/admin/AdminSupportDashboard.tsx` - Use admin wrapper
- `src/modules/support-desk/components/admin/AdminTicketDetailWrapper.tsx` - New wrapper
- `src/modules/support-desk/components/admin/TicketActions.tsx` - Admin controls
- `src/modules/support-desk/components/shared/TicketDetail.tsx` - Dark theme fixes
- `src/modules/support-desk/components/admin/AdminTicketList.tsx` - Filter fixes

### Agent System
- `.claude/agents/` - Complete agent collection (45+ agent files)
- `CLAUDE.md` - Updated to mention AI agent system

## Key Technical Details

### Support Desk Fixes
1. **Client-side Filtering**: Implemented for assignment status to avoid database errors
2. **Component Hierarchy**: Created AdminTicketDetailWrapper to enable canManage=true
3. **Theme Consistency**: Changed all bg-white to bg-gray-800/50 with border-gray-700

### Agent Usage Patterns
1. **Direct Address**: "Master Project Manager: Build [feature]"
2. **Multi-Agent**: "I need [agent1] and [agent2] to collaborate on [task]"
3. **Orchestration**: PM breaks down projects into phases and delegates

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
- Test the Master Project Manager with a real feature request
- Monitor support desk performance with fixed filtering
- Consider creating additional Car Audio Events specific agents

### Future Enhancements
- Add database-expert and security-expert dedicated agent files
- Create agent templates for common Car Audio Events workflows
- Build agent performance tracking system
