npx bmad-method flatten

# Update BMAD installation
npx bmad-method install

# With custom paths
npx bmad-method flatten --input ./src --output codebase.xml
```

### Workflow Process

#### Phase 1: Planning (Days 1-3)
1. **Analyst** creates Product Requirements Document (PRD)
2. **Project Manager** refines specifications
3. **Architect** designs system architecture
4. Documents reviewed with stakeholders

#### Phase 2: Development (Days 4-13)
1. **Scrum Master** transforms plans into detailed stories
2. **Developer** implements features with full context
3. **QA** validates implementation
4. Cycle repeats for each story

#### Phase 3: Review (Day 14)
1. Sprint review with stakeholders
2. Retrospective for improvements
3. Planning for next sprint

## 🎉 Next Steps

1. **Start Planning**: Use `*analyst` to begin requirements gathering
2. **Create Stories**: Use `*sm` to create detailed user stories
3. **Implement Features**: Use `*dev` for context-aware development
4. **Ensure Quality**: Use `*qa` for testing and validation

### Example Workflow
```bash
# Start with the orchestrator
*bmad-orchestrator

# Begin planning phase
*analyst
"I need to add a new feature for competitor check-in via QR codes"

# Move to architecture
*architect
"Design the QR code check-in system"

# Create development stories
*sm
"Transform the QR check-in design into implementation stories"

# Start development
*dev
"Implement story CAE-001: QR Code Generation for Competitors"
```
