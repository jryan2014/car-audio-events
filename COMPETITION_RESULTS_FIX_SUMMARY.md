# Competition Results Column Name Fix Summary

## Issue Description
The AdminLeaderboardManager component was failing when trying to verify competition results with a 400 Bad Request error. The issue was caused by the frontend code querying the `competition_results` table with incorrect column names that don't exist in the actual database schema.

## Root Cause
The middleware files and components were using column names from an outdated or different schema:

**Incorrect columns being queried:**
- `competitor_id` (should be `user_id`)
- `created_by` (doesn't exist)
- `organization_id` (doesn't exist)
- `is_verified` (should be `verified`)
- `is_public` (doesn't exist)
- `competition_id` (doesn't exist)

**Actual database schema for competition_results table:**
- `id` (uuid)
- `user_id` (uuid)
- `event_id` (integer)
- `category` (varchar)
- `position` (integer)
- `score` (decimal)
- `notes` (text)
- `verified` (boolean)
- `verified_by` (uuid)
- `verified_at` (timestamptz)
- `created_at` (timestamptz)
- `updated_at` (timestamptz)

## Files Fixed

### 1. `src/middleware/permission-guards.ts`
- Updated `CompetitionResult` interface to match actual database schema
- Fixed all SELECT queries to use correct column names
- Updated ownership validation logic to use `user_id` instead of `competitor_id`
- Removed references to non-existent columns like `created_by`, `organization_id`, `is_public`
- Changed `is_verified` to `verified` throughout the file

### 2. `src/middleware/security-validation.ts`
- Updated `CompetitionResultSchema` to use correct column names
- Changed `competitor_id` to `user_id`
- Changed `event_id` from string UUID to number to match database type

### 3. `src/components/LogCAEEventModal.tsx`
- Removed duplicate `competitor_id` field, keeping only `user_id`

## Testing
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- ✅ Development server starts successfully on port 5173
- ✅ No more column name mismatches in database queries

## Impact
This fix resolves the critical issue where administrators could not verify competition results through the AdminLeaderboardManager interface. The verification toggle should now work correctly without the 400 Bad Request errors.

## Next Steps
1. Test the verification functionality in the admin panel
2. Verify that all CRUD operations on competition results work correctly
3. Check that the leaderboard displays properly with the corrected column names
