# Email Verification System Findings & Solutions

## Current Issues

### 1. Todd Kirkendall Registration Issue
- **Problem**: User does not exist in the database
- **Possible Causes**:
  - Registration failed before user record was created
  - Email verification wasn't received/clicked
  - Auth user might exist but profile wasn't created

### 2. Email Verification System
- **Status**: Code is properly implemented
- **Process**:
  1. User registers → Auth user created in Supabase Auth
  2. Profile created in users table with `verification_status = 'pending'`
  3. Verification email sent via `supabase.auth.resend()`
  4. User clicks link → Email verified in Supabase Auth
  5. User should update `verification_status = 'verified'` after confirmation

### 3. Subscription Plan Field Issue
- **Problem**: Shows "monthly" instead of actual membership plan
- **Solution Applied**: Added `membership_plan_id` column to properly link to membership plans
- **View Created**: `user_memberships` view for easy access to plan details

## Required Actions

### 1. Check Supabase Email Settings
In Supabase Dashboard:
1. Go to Authentication → Email Templates
2. Ensure "Enable Email" is ON
3. Check SMTP settings are configured
4. Verify email templates are set up for:
   - Confirmation (sign up)
   - Magic Link
   - Change Email Address

### 2. Update User Display to Show Correct Plan
The UserDetails page needs to show the actual membership plan name instead of subscription_plan field.

### 3. Debug Todd's Registration
To investigate:
1. Check Supabase Auth logs for Todd's email
2. Check email provider spam folder
3. Try registering with the same email again

## Code Updates Needed

### 1. Fix Subscription Plan Display in UserDetails.tsx
Instead of showing `subscription_plan`, we should:
- Join with membership_plans table
- Show the plan name (Free, Competitor, Pro, etc.)
- Show billing period separately if needed

### 2. Add Email Verification Status Check
- When user logs in, check if email is verified
- If not verified, show message and resend option
- Don't allow full access until verified

### 3. Better Registration Error Handling
- Log registration attempts to activity_logs
- Better error messages for duplicate emails
- Check if auth user exists without profile

## Email Templates Found
The system has these email templates:
- Email Verification
- Pre-Registration Email Verification
- Welcome email (via edge function)

## Next Steps
1. Check Supabase Dashboard email configuration
2. Update UserDetails to show correct membership plan
3. Add email verification status checks to login flow
4. Test registration with a new email address
