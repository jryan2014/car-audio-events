# Featured Events Implementation

## ðŸŽ¯ **Overview**
Implemented a comprehensive featured events system that allows events to be marked as "featured" and displayed prominently on the home page with realistic car audio placeholder events as fallback.

## âœ… **What Was Implemented**

### **1. Database Schema Updates**
- Added `is_featured` boolean column to events table (defaults to false)
- Added `image_url` text column for event images
- Created performance indexes for featured events queries
- Added RLS policies for public access to featured events

### **2. Home Page Enhancement**
- **Dynamic Featured Events**: Fetches up to 3 featured events from database
- **Realistic Placeholders**: Car audio themed placeholder events with proper images
- **Smart Fallback**: Shows database events when available, placeholders otherwise
- **Category-Based Images**: Automatic image selection based on event category
- **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators and error handling
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly event cards with hover effects

### **3. Event Creation Form Updates**
- Added "Feature on home page" toggle in Visibility section
- Includes helpful description text
- Saves `is_featured` status when creating events
- Admin and authorized users can mark events as featured

### **4. Realistic Car Audio Content**
- **IASCA World Finals 2025** - Championship event in Orlando, FL
- **dB Drag Racing National Event** - SPL Competition in Phoenix, AZ  
- **MECA Spring Sound Quality Championship** - Sound Quality event in Atlanta, GA
- High-quality car audio images from Unsplash
- Proper participant counts and event categories

## ðŸ”§ **Technical Implementation**

### **Database Changes Required**
```sql
-- Run this in your Supabase SQL Editor:
DO $$
BEGIN
    IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.columns 
                   WHERE table_name = 'events' AND column_name = 'is_featured') THEN
        ALTER TABLE events ADD COLUMN is_featured BOOLEAN DEFAULT false;
    END IF;
    
    IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.columns 
                   WHERE table_name = 'events' AND column_name = 'image_url') THEN
        ALTER TABLE events ADD COLUMN image_url TEXT;
    END IF;
END $$;

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_events_is_featured ON events(is_featured) WHERE is_featured = true;
```

### **Key Features**
- **Smart Query**: Only fetches published, future events marked as featured
- **Category Integration**: Links with event_categories table for proper categorization
- **Image Fallback**: Automatic category-based image selection if no custom image
- **Date Formatting**: Proper date range display (single day vs multi-day events)
- **Participant Display**: Shows current/max participants when available
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to placeholders on database errors

### **Files Modified**
- `src/pages/Home.tsx` - Enhanced with database integration and realistic placeholders
- `src/pages/CreateEvent.tsx` - Added featured toggle to event creation form
- `add-featured-events-support.sql` - Database schema updates

## ðŸŽ¨ **Visual Improvements**
- **Realistic Images**: Car audio competition photos from Unsplash
- **Category Badges**: Color-coded event type indicators
- **Participant Counters**: Live participant count display
- **Loading Skeletons**: Smooth loading experience
- **Hover Effects**: Interactive event cards with scale animations

## ðŸš€ **Usage Instructions**

### **For Event Organizers:**
1. Create an event through the Event Manager
2. In the "Visibility" section, check "Feature on home page"
3. Add a high-quality event image URL (optional - will use category default)
4. Publish the event (status = 'published')
5. Event will appear on home page for future dates

### **For Administrators:**
- Featured events are automatically filtered to show only published, future events
- Up to 3 featured events display on home page
- Events are ordered by start date (earliest first)
- Placeholder events show when no database events are featured

## ðŸ“Š **Benefits**
- **Dynamic Content**: Home page automatically updates with real events
- **Professional Appearance**: Realistic car audio themed content
- **User Control**: Event organizers can control home page visibility
- **Performance Optimized**: Indexed queries and efficient data fetching
- **Fallback System**: Always shows engaging content even without database events

## ðŸ”„ **Next Steps**
1. Run the SQL script in Supabase dashboard
2. Test event creation with featured toggle
3. Create some test events and mark them as featured
4. Verify home page displays real events instead of placeholders
