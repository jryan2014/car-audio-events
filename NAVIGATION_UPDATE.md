# Navigation Menu Update - January 27, 2025

## Change: Unified Member Directory

### What was changed:
- Removed "Public Directory" link from the Community dropdown menu in navigation
- Unified all member directory functionality into a single `/members` route
- Added "Member Directory" link visible to ALL users (including non-authenticated)

### Database Migrations Applied:

#### Migration 1: Remove Public Directory
```sql
-- Remove Public Directory link from navigation menu
DELETE FROM navigation_menu_items 
WHERE title = 'Public Directory' 
   OR href = '/public-directory'
   OR href LIKE '%public-directory%';

-- Update any parent references if needed
UPDATE navigation_menu_items 
SET href = '/members'
WHERE href = '/public-directory';
```

#### Migration 2: Add Member Directory for All Users
```sql
-- Ensure Member Directory is visible to everyone including non-authenticated users
DELETE FROM navigation_menu_items 
WHERE title = 'Member Directory' OR href = '/members';

-- Insert Member Directory under Community menu with 'base' membership context
INSERT INTO navigation_menu_items (...)
VALUES ('Member Directory', '/members', ... membership_contexts: ['base'] ...);
```

### How it works now:
- Single `/members` page accessible to everyone
- Navigation shows "Member Directory" link to all visitors
- Content varies based on authentication:
  - **Non-authenticated users**: See only public profiles + "Join Our Community" CTA
  - **Authenticated users**: See both public and members-only profiles
  - **Private profiles**: Never shown in directory

These migrations have been applied to the production database.
