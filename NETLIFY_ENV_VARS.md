# Netlify Environment Variables

This file documents all environment variables that need to be set in Netlify for production deployment.

## Required Environment Variables

### Supabase Configuration
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` - Your Supabase project URL
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Your Supabase anonymous key

### Google Maps
- `VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` - Your Google Maps API key (restricted to your domain)

### hCaptcha
- `VITE_HCAPTCHA_SITE_KEY` - Your hCaptcha site key

### TinyMCE Editor (Optional)
- `VITE_TINYMCE_API_KEY` - Your TinyMCE API key
  - Note: This is optional as we have a fallback hardcoded in `src/config/tinymce.ts`
  - The hardcoded key is: `2l8fxsmp22j75yhpuwrv2rbm6ygm83mk72jr7per4x4j77hl`
  - TinyMCE keys are domain-restricted and safe to be public

### Payment Providers (Optional)
- `VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` - Your Stripe publishable key
- `VITE_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID` - Your PayPal client ID

## Setting Environment Variables in Netlify

1. Go to your Netlify dashboard
2. Select your site
3. Go to Site settings â†’ Environment variables
4. Add each variable with its value
5. Deploy your site - the variables will be available during the build

## Notes

- All environment variables prefixed with `VITE_` are exposed to the client-side code
- Never put sensitive keys (like Supabase service role key) in VITE_ variables
- The TinyMCE API key is hardcoded as a fallback to prevent issues when agents overwrite the .env file
