- Example: Organization tier gets 10 support reps, Retailer gets 3 reps

### 4. Marketing Ad Size Limits

- 320x50 - Mobile Banner ads
- Plus newsletter and campaign creation limits
- Each size can have different monthly limits per tier

### 5. Comprehensive Timeframe Support
Added timeframe selectors for ALL permission limits:

**Available Timeframes:**
- **Per Day** - Resets daily at midnight
- **Per Week** - Resets weekly on Monday
- **Per Month** - Resets on the 1st of each month
- **Per Year** - Resets January 1st
- **Lifetime** - Never resets (total allowed)

**Implementation Details:**
- Timeframe selector dropdowns for each action in the edit modal
- Timeframe abbreviations shown in table headers (/day, /week, /mo, /yr, total)
- Support reps excluded from timeframe selectors (always lifetime)
- Database column `limit_timeframes` stores timeframe per action
- Helper functions for timeframe-based usage checking

## Database Changes

### New Column Added
```sql
ALTER TABLE feature_registry 
ADD COLUMN limit_timeframes JSONB DEFAULT '{}';
```

### Example Data Structure
```json
{
  "create": "monthly",
  "edit": "daily",
  "delete": "weekly",
  "create_728x90": "monthly",
  "create_300x250": "monthly",
  "manage_reps": "lifetime"
}
```

### Helper Functions Created
1. `get_feature_limit_with_timeframe()` - Returns limit value and timeframe
2. `check_usage_within_timeframe()` - Validates if user is within limits based on timeframe

## UI Implementation

### Edit Modal Enhancements
1. **Help Icons** - All sections have tooltips with explanatory text
2. **View Examples Button** - Shows relevant actions for selected category
3. **Timeframe Selectors** - Dropdown for each action to set time period
4. **Smart Table Headers** - Shows action name with timeframe abbreviation
5. **Category-Specific Notes** - Blue/yellow info boxes for marketing/support

### Visual Indicators
- Timeframe abbreviations in table headers
- Color-coded info boxes for special categories
- Disabled timeframe selectors for lifetime limits (support reps)
- Real-time updates as selections change

   - Tools: Set use=daily, export=monthly

4. **Save and Verify**
