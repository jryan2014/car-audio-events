# Permission System - Visibility & Upsell Features Complete ✅

## Major Improvements Implemented

### 1. ✅ AI Ad Creation - All or Nothing
**Before**: Separate AI creation for each ad size (too granular)
**Now**: Single `ai_create` action - you either have AI access or you don't
- Manufacturer & Organization tiers get AI access
- Everyone else uploads pre-made ads only
- AI creator is COMPLETELY HIDDEN if you don't have access

### 2. ✅ Visibility Modes - Control What Users See
Three visibility modes for each feature:

**`hidden`** - Feature is COMPLETELY INVISIBLE if user doesn't have access
- No UI elements shown at all
- No support tickets about "why can't I use this"
- Example: AI Ad Creator for lower tiers

**`when_available`** - Only shows when user has access
- Standard behavior for most features
- Clean UI without clutter

**`always`** - Always visible, shows upsell if no access
- Good for features you want to promote
- Shows upgrade prompts
- Example: Teams feature

### 3. ✅ Upsell Configuration - Monetize Add-ons
New upsell system for paid add-ons:
- **Custom Team Titles**: $9.99/month add-on
- Only available to pro_competitor+ tiers
- Shows upgrade prompt with pricing
- Configurable per feature

### 4. ✅ Teams - Create vs Join Permissions
Properly separated team permissions:

**Free & Competitor**: 
- ✅ View teams
- ✅ Join existing teams
- ❌ Cannot create teams

**Pro Competitor**:
- ✅ Everything above PLUS
- ✅ Create teams
- ✅ Manage teams
- ✅ Invite members
- ❌ Custom titles (paid add-on)

**Retailer/Manufacturer/Organization**:
- ✅ All team features
- ✅ Can purchase custom titles add-on
- ✅ Team analytics (Manufacturer+)

### 5. ✅ Per-Tier Action Control
Each tier can have DIFFERENT actions for the same feature:
- Matrix view shows checkboxes for each tier/action combo
- Usage limits show "N/A" for actions a tier doesn't have
- Much more flexible than all-or-nothing

## New UI Features

### Edit Modal Enhancements

#### Visibility Mode Selector
```
Visibility Mode: [Dropdown]
- Hidden (Invisible without access)
- When Available (Show only with access)  
- Always (Show with upsell if no access)
```

#### Upsell Configuration (when visibility = "always")
```
☑ This is a paid add-on
Add-on Price: $[9.99]/month
Upsell Message: [Upgrade to unlock custom team titles...]
```

#### Action Permission Matrix
```
Action          | Free | Competitor | Pro Competitor | Retailer |
----------------|------|------------|----------------|----------|
view_teams      | ✓    | ✓          | ✓              | ✓        |
join_team       | ✓    | ✓          | ✓              | ✓        |
create_team     | ✗    | ✗          | ✓              | ✓        |
custom_titles   | ✗    | ✗          | ✗ (upsell)     | ✗ (upsell)|
```

## Database Schema Updates

### New Columns
- `visibility_mode`: VARCHAR(20) - Controls feature visibility
- `upsell_config`: JSONB - Stores upsell configuration
- `tier_actions`: JSONB - Which actions each tier gets

### Example Upsell Config
```json
{
  "custom_titles": {
    "is_addon": true,
    "addon_price": 9.99,
    "upsell_message": "Unlock custom team titles for $9.99/month",
    "required_base_tier": ["pro_competitor", "retailer", "manufacturer", "organization"]
  }
}
```

## Key Benefits

### For Users
- **Cleaner UI**: Don't see features they can't use
- **Clear Upgrade Path**: Know exactly what they get at each tier
- **No Confusion**: Hidden features = no support tickets

### For Business
- **Monetization**: Add-on features generate extra revenue
- **Upsell Opportunities**: Strategic feature visibility drives upgrades
- **Reduced Support**: Hidden features = fewer "why can't I?" tickets

## Testing Checklist

1. **AI Ad Creator**

   - ✓ Single ai_create action, not per-size

2. **Teams Feature**
   - ✓ Free/Competitor can join but not create
   - ✓ Pro Competitor+ can create teams
   - ✓ Custom titles show as paid add-on

3. **Visibility Modes**

## Summary

- **Complete feature hiding** (no UI = no confusion)

This creates a much better user experience while opening up monetization opportunities through strategic feature visibility and paid add-ons!
