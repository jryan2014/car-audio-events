# Pricing Flow Fixes - January 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Removed Stripe Configuration Alerts from Public View
**Problem**: Public users and members were seeing "Payment integration requires Stripe configuration" alerts.
**Solution**: 
- Removed the alert message that exposed Stripe configuration status
- Changed to handle demo mode silently with a simple callback
- Demo mode banner now only shows in localhost development

### 2. ✅ Fixed Admin Role Handling
**Problem**: Admins were seeing upgrade/downgrade messages when clicking pricing plans.
**Solution**: 
- Added check for admin role - admins now just navigate to dashboard
- No upgrade/downgrade messages shown to admin users

### 3. ✅ Fixed Free Plan Selection Logic
**Problem**: Members clicking "Get Started Free" were told they were upgraded.
**Solution**:
- Added logic to detect current membership type
- Free members see: "You already have a free Competitor membership"
- Pro members get confirmation before downgrading
- Proper messaging for each scenario

### 4. ✅ Fixed Pro Plan Upgrade Logic
**Problem**: Incorrect messages when switching between membership levels.
**Solution**:
- Pro members see: "You already have a Pro Competitor membership"
- Free members see: "Successfully upgraded to Pro Competitor!"
- Other paid members see: "Successfully changed to Pro Competitor plan!"

### 5. ✅ Improved Payment Processing Messages
**Problem**: Stripe configuration errors shown to users.
**Solution**:
- Replaced technical error with: "Payment processing will be available soon. Please check back later."
- No technical details exposed to end users
