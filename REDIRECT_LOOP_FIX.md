# üîß Redirect Loop Fix - January 2025

## Issue
After successful payment and email verification, users were experiencing an infinite redirect loop when clicking the verification link. The system was:
1. Trying to redirect pending approval users to `/pending-approval`
2. That route didn't exist, causing a 404
3. User gets redirected back, creating an infinite loop

## Root Cause
The AuthContext was blocking access for business accounts (retailer, manufacturer, organization) with `status === 'pending'` and redirecting them to a non-existent `/pending-approval` route.

## Solution Applied
1. **Modified AuthContext.tsx** - Removed the redirect for pending approval users
   - Now allows them to continue to the dashboard with limited access
   - The Dashboard component handles showing appropriate limited features

2. **Updated Dashboard.tsx** - Added pending approval view
   - Shows "Account Pending Approval" message
   - Displays limited profile information
   - Provides links to browse resources and view events while waiting

## Changes Made

### src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx
```javascript
// OLD: Blocked access and redirected
if (['retailer', 'manufacturer', 'organization'].includes(userProfile.membershipType) && 
    userProfile.status === 'pending' && 
    userProfile.verificationStatus !== 'pending') {
  console.log('‚è≥ Business account pending manual approval');
  setSession(null);
  setUser(null);
  setLoading(false);
  localStorage.setItem('pending_approval_email', userProfile.email);
  window.location.href = '/pending-approval';
  return;
}

// NEW: Allow access with limited features
if (['retailer', 'manufacturer', 'organization'].includes(userProfile.membershipType) && 
    userProfile.status === 'pending' && 
    userProfile.verificationStatus !== 'pending') {
  console.log('‚è≥ Business account pending manual approval - allowing limited access');
  // Don't block access - set user and continue
  // The Dashboard component will handle showing limited features
}
```

### src/pages/Dashboard.tsx
Added a new section to handle pending approval users with:
- Clear "Account Pending Approval" message
- Limited profile view showing their information
- Links to browse resources and events while waiting
- Estimated approval time (1-2 business days)

## Email Configuration Note
The user reported that verification emails are coming from Supabase instead of the custom domain email `verify@caraudioevents.com`. 

### To Fix Email Sender:
1. **Option 1: Custom SMTP** - Configure Supabase to use custom SMTP settings
   - Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Authentication ‚Üí Email Templates
   - Configure SMTP settings with your email provider
   - Set sender email to `verify@caraudioevents.com`

2. **Option 2: Email Edge Functions** - Use the existing email edge functions
   - The system already has edge functions for sending emails (send-mailgun-email, send-zoho-email)
   - These can be configured to send from custom domains
   - Update the email templates to use these functions

3. **Option 3: Postmark Integration** - The system appears to have Postmark configured
   - Check Netlify environment variables for Postmark configuration
   - Update email templates to use Postmark for sending

## Testing the Fix
1. Create a new business account (retailer/manufacturer/organization)
2. Complete payment
3. Verify email
4. Click verification link
5. Should now see the pending approval dashboard view without redirect loops

## Future Improvements
1. Create a proper `/pending-approval` route if needed
2. Add email notifications when accounts are approved
3. Show estimated approval time based on actual admin response times
4. Allow partial access to more features during pending state
