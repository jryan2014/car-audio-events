# Security Notes

## Known Vulnerabilities

### react-quill / quill XSS Vulnerability
- **Status**: Acknowledged but not immediately fixable
- **Issue**: react-quill@2.0.0 depends on vulnerable quill@1.3.7
- **CVE**: Cross-site Scripting in quill (GHSA-4943-9vgg-gr5r)
- **Risk Level**: Moderate
- **Mitigation**: 
  - Input is sanitized using DOMPurify before rendering
  - Rich text editor is only available to authenticated users
  - Content is only displayed to the user who created it initially
- **Action Plan**: Monitor for react-quill updates that support React 18 and quill 2.x
- **Next Steps**: Consider replacing with TinyMCE (already integrated) or other modern editor

## Mitigations in Place

1. **HTML Sanitization**: All user input is sanitized using DOMPurify
2. **CSP Headers**: Strict Content Security Policy blocks inline scripts
3. **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation on all forms
4. **Authentication**: Rich text editing requires authentication
5. **Output Encoding**: All dynamic content is properly encoded
