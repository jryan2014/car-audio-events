## Security Infrastructure Implemented

### Multi-Layer Defense System
1. **Authentication Layer**: Enhanced auth context with retry logic and fingerprinting
2. **Authorization Layer**: Resource authorization middleware with ownership validation
3. **Validation Layer**: Zod schemas with comprehensive input validation
4. **Rate Limiting Layer**: Database-backed rate limiting for all sensitive endpoints
5. **CSRF Protection Layer**: Double-submit cookie pattern implementation
6. **Audit Layer**: Comprehensive audit logging for all security events
7. **Monitoring Layer**: Real-time security event monitoring and alerting

### Security Tools & Scripts
- `scripts/scan-for-secrets.ts` - Automated secret detection
- `scripts/rotate-keys.ts` - Key rotation automation
- `scripts/setup-security.ts` - Security configuration setup
- Pre-commit hooks for security scanning

## Verification & Testing

### Automated Security Checks
```bash
npm run security:full-scan  # Runs comprehensive security audit
npm run security:audit      # NPM vulnerability scan
npm run scan-secrets        # Secret detection scan
```

### Manual Verification Steps
1. ✅ Supabase Security Advisor: 0 warnings
2. ✅ NPM Audit: 0 vulnerabilities
3. ✅ All SECURITY DEFINER functions have SET search_path
4. ✅ No service keys in client code
5. ✅ All edge functions use proper CORS configuration
6. ✅ Rate limiting active on all payment endpoints
7. ✅ CSRF protection enabled on state-changing operations

## Production Deployment Checklist

### Environment Variables Required
```env
# Add to production environment
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://caraudioevents.com,https://*.caraudioevents.com
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=[vault-reference]
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=[vault-reference]
PAYPAL_SECRET=[vault-reference]
```

### Post-Deployment Verification
1. Run Supabase Security Advisor check
2. Verify all edge functions are deployed
3. Test rate limiting on payment endpoints
4. Verify CORS headers in browser DevTools
5. Check audit logs are being generated

## Ongoing Security Maintenance

### Daily Tasks
- Monitor audit logs for suspicious activity
- Review rate limit violations
- Check for new dependency vulnerabilities

### Weekly Tasks
- Run full security scan
- Review and rotate API keys if needed
- Analyze security metrics and trends

### Monthly Tasks
- Comprehensive security audit
- Update security documentation
- Review and update security policies

## Security Metrics
