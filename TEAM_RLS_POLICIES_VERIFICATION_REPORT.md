# Team System RLS Policies Verification Report

## Executive Summary

This report documents the verification and creation of comprehensive Row Level Security (RLS) policies for the Car Audio Events platform's team system. The analysis was conducted on 2025-08-27 to ensure all team-related tables have proper security configurations.

## Tables Analyzed

The following tables were examined for RLS policy compliance:

1. **`teams`** - Main team information table
2. **`team_members`** - Team membership relationships 
3. **`team_join_requests`** - Join request management table
4. **`user_audio_systems`** - User profile audio system configurations

## Current State Analysis

### Migration Files Found
- âœ… `20250108_team_join_requests.sql` - Core team join request functionality
- âœ… `20250108_team_join_request_notifications.sql` - Notification system
- âœ… `20250109_add_team_active_status.sql` - Team status management
- âœ… `20250827_verify_team_rls_policies.sql` - **NEW: Comprehensive RLS policies**

### Issues Identified & Fixed
1. **Migration Dependency Issues**: Fixed `20240318_add_diagram_configuration.sql` and `20250108_001_permission_enhancement_safe.sql` to be conditional on table existence
2. **Incomplete RLS Coverage**: Created comprehensive policies for all team-related tables
3. **Security Gaps**: Added proper access controls for public vs private teams

## RLS Policies Created

### 1. Teams Table Policies

```sql
-- Public teams are visible to everyone
CREATE POLICY "Public can view public teams" ON public.teams
    FOR SELECT TO anon, authenticated
    USING (is_public = true);

CREATE POLICY "Team members can view their teams" ON public.teams
    FOR SELECT TO authenticated
    USING (
        EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM public.team_members tm
            WHERE tm.team_id = teams.id
            AND tm.user_id = (SELECT auth.uid())
        )
    );
```

            AND tm2.user_id = user_audio_systems.user_id
        )
    );
```

## Security Features Implemented

### 1. Public vs Private Team Access Control
- **Public teams**: Visible to all users, including anonymous users
- **Private teams**: Only visible to team members and team admins
- **Team rosters**: Public team members visible to all; private team members only visible to teammates

### 2. Hierarchical Permission System
- **Team owners**: Full control over their teams and all memberships
- **Team captains/co-captains**: Can view and respond to join requests
- **Team members**: Can view team information and teammates
- **Regular users**: Can create join requests and view public information

### 3. Join Request Security
- **Duplicate prevention**: Users cannot request to join teams they're already members of
- **Status-based access**: Only pending requests can be cancelled by users
- **Admin approval**: Only team leadership can approve/reject requests
- **Audit trail**: All responses tracked with timestamp and responding user

### 4. Audio System Privacy
- **Public profiles**: Audio systems marked as public are visible to everyone
- **Private profiles**: Only visible to the owner and teammates
- **Team collaboration**: Team members can view each other's setups for collaboration

## Database Migration Status

### Files Ready for Deployment
1. âœ… `supabase/migrations/20250827_verify_team_rls_policies.sql` - Main RLS policy migration
2. âœ… Fixed `20240318_add_diagram_configuration.sql` - Now conditional on table existence
3. âœ… Fixed `20250108_001_permission_enhancement_safe.sql` - Now conditional on table existence

### Deployment Command
```bash
# To deploy to production
cd "E:\2025-car-audio-events\car-audio-events"
npx supabase db push

# To verify policies are applied
# Run the verification query included in the migration
```

## Verification Query

To verify all policies are properly applied, run this query:

```sql
-- Verification query to check RLS policies
SELECT 
    'FINAL VERIFICATION' as check_type,
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    policyname,
    cmd as operation,
    CASE 
        WHEN qual IS NOT NULL THEN 'Has USING clause'
        ELSE 'No USING clause'
    END as using_clause,
    CASE 
        WHEN with_check IS NOT NULL THEN 'Has WITH CHECK clause'
        ELSE 'No WITH CHECK clause'
    END as with_check_clause
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
AND tablename IN ('teams', 'team_members', 'team_join_requests', 'user_audio_systems')
ORDER BY tablename, policyname;
```

## Security Compliance

### âœ… Completed Security Requirements
1. **Row Level Security Enabled**: All team-related tables have RLS enabled
2. **Public Access Control**: Anonymous users can only view public information
3. **Authenticated Access Control**: Users can only access appropriate data based on membership
4. **Admin Access Control**: Team owners/admins have proper management permissions
5. **Data Privacy**: Private team information is properly protected
6. **Audit Trail**: All join request actions are tracked

### ðŸ”’ Security Best Practices Implemented
1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users only have access to data they need
2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security checks
3. **Explicit Permissions**: All access is explicitly granted, nothing is implicit
4. **Conditional Execution**: Migration scripts are safe to run multiple times
5. **Table Existence Checks**: No errors if tables don't exist yet

## Recommendations for Deployment

1. **Test in Staging**: Apply migrations to staging environment first
2. **Verify Table Structure**: Ensure all referenced tables exist before deployment
3. **Monitor Performance**: Check query performance after policy deployment
4. **User Testing**: Verify access patterns work correctly for all user types
5. **Backup Strategy**: Ensure database backup before applying policies

## Conclusion

The team system RLS policies have been comprehensively reviewed and updated to ensure proper security controls. All team-related tables now have appropriate policies that:

1. Protect private team information
2. Allow appropriate public access
3. Enable team collaboration features
4. Prevent unauthorized access
5. Support the platform's team management workflow

The migration is ready for deployment to the production database (project ID: xkkqtiuqyiyqympzmqwe).
