# URL Redirect Mapping Documentation
Date: 2025-08-06
Version: v1.26.121

## Overview
This document outlines the URL redirect mappings from the old WordPress site to the new React SPA to maintain SEO rankings and ensure users coming from search engines (Google, Bing) land on the correct pages.

## Redirect Mappings (301 Permanent Redirects)

| Old URL | New URL | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `/full-transparency-disclaimer/` | `/resources` | Transparency policy now in Resources section |
| `/full-transparency-disclaimer` | `/resources` | Transparency policy now in Resources section |
| `/contact/` | `/support` | Contact form replaced with Support system |
| `/contact` | `/support` | Contact form replaced with Support system |
| `/clients/` | `/login` | Client portal is now the login page |
| `/clients` | `/login` | Client portal is now the login page |
| `/client-portal/` | `/login` | Client portal is now the login page |
| `/client-portal` | `/login` | Client portal is now the login page |
| `/about/` | `/pages/about` | About page in CMS |
| `/about` | `/pages/about` | About page in CMS |
| `/blog/` | `/resources` | Blog content moved to Resources |
| `/blog` | `/resources` | Blog content moved to Resources |
| `/blog/*` | `/resources` | All blog posts redirect to Resources |

## Implementation Details

### Technology
- **Hosting Platform**: Netlify
- **Configuration File**: `netlify.toml`
- **Redirect Type**: 301 (Permanent) with `force = true`

### Why 301 Redirects?
- **SEO Preservation**: 301 redirects pass link equity to the new URLs
- **Search Engine Updates**: Tells Google/Bing to update their indexes
- **User Experience**: Users land on relevant content automatically
- **Browser Caching**: Browsers cache 301 redirects for faster future visits

### Force Flag
The `force = true` flag ensures redirects happen even if a file exists at that path, preventing conflicts with the SPA routing.

## Testing Instructions

After deployment, test each redirect:

1. **Direct Browser Test**:
   - Visit: `https://caraudioevents.com/full-transparency-disclaimer/`
   - Should redirect to: `https://caraudioevents.com/resources`

2. **Check Response Headers**:
   ```bash
   curl -I https://caraudioevents.com/contact/
   ```
   Should show: `HTTP/2 301` and `Location: https://caraudioevents.com/support`

3. **Google Search Console**:
   - Monitor for crawl errors
   - Check if Google recognizes the redirects
   - Update sitemap if needed

4. **Bing Webmaster Tools**:
   - Verify redirects are working
   - Monitor for any indexing issues

## SEO Impact

### Positive Effects:
- ✅ Maintains link equity from external sites
- ✅ Prevents 404 errors in search results
- ✅ Updates search engine indexes over time
- ✅ Preserves user bookmarks

### Timeline:
- **Immediate**: Users redirected to correct pages
- **1-2 weeks**: Search engines begin recognizing redirects
- **1-3 months**: Full index update in search engines

## Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Track:
1. **404 Error Rate**: Should decrease to near zero
2. **Organic Traffic**: Should remain stable or increase
3. **Bounce Rate**: Monitor for unusual changes
4. **Search Rankings**: Track key terms over 30 days

### Tools:
- Google Search Console
- Bing Webmaster Tools
- Netlify Analytics
- Google Analytics

## Future Considerations

1. **Sitemap Update**: Consider submitting updated sitemap to search engines
2. **Content Migration**: If old blog content exists, consider migrating to Resources
3. **About Page**: Consider creating dedicated `/about` route if needed
4. **Redirect Cleanup**: After 6-12 months, evaluate if all redirects still needed

## Deployment

These redirects will be active immediately upon deployment to Netlify. No additional configuration needed beyond the `netlify.toml` file changes.
