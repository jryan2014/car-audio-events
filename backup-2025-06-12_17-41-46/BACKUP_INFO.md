**Description:** Admin Dashboard Refresh Fix - React Hooks violation resolved
**Files:** 314 files backed up

## 🎯 **Problem Solved:**
Fixed critical issue where Admin Dashboard (`/admin/dashboard`) would go blank when refreshed due to React Hooks violation.

## 🔧 **Changes Made:**

### **Primary Fix - AdminDashboard.tsx:**
- **Fixed React Hooks violation** - moved `useEffect` hook before conditional returns
- **Replaced missing database function** - `get_recent_activity` with direct table queries
- **Added proper loading states** and error handling for authentication and data loading
- **Enhanced error boundaries** with retry functionality

### **Secondary Fix - Dashboard.tsx:**
- **Added scroll-to-top** functionality on refresh for better UX
- **Enhanced loading state management** for regular user dashboard

### **Security Enhancement:**
- **Updated .gitignore** to protect sensitive files (env-local, env-remote, .env, *.backup)

## 📁 **Key Files Modified:**
- `src/pages/AdminDashboard.tsx` (Fixed React Hooks violation)
- `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` (Added scroll-to-top on refresh)
- `.gitignore` (Enhanced security)

## 🚀 **Results:**
- ✅ Admin dashboard now refreshes properly without going blank
- ✅ No more React Hooks errors in console
- ✅ Proper loading states during authentication and data loading
- ✅ Real user and event data displayed from database
- ✅ Enhanced error handling with retry functionality

## 📊 **Technical Details:**
- **Root Cause:** React Hooks violation - conditional early returns before `useEffect`
- **Error:** "Rendered more hooks than during the previous render"
- **Solution:** Moved all hooks to top of component before any conditional logic
- **Database Fix:** Replaced missing RPC function with direct table queries
