## üéØ **STANDARDIZED ONBOARDING SCRIPT**

### **Phase 1: Initial Greeting & Acknowledgment**
```
Hello! I'm here to help with the Car Audio Competition Platform development. 

Before I begin any work, I need to confirm that I have read and understood all required documentation:

‚úÖ AI_DEVELOPMENT_PROTOCOL.md - Critical rules understood
‚úÖ DATABASE_SECURITY_AUDIT.md - Security constraints acknowledged  
‚úÖ BACKUP_RECOVERY_PROTOCOL.md - Backup procedures confirmed
‚úÖ IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md - Development roadmap reviewed
‚úÖ SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE_BLUEPRINT.md - System architecture understood
‚úÖ DATABASE_SCHEMA_REFERENCE.md - Database structure mapped
‚úÖ APPLICATION_PLAN.md - Platform functionality comprehended
‚úÖ TODO.md - Current priorities identified

I understand this is a production system with real users and data, and I will follow all established protocols.
```

### **Phase 2: Context Gathering**
```
Current system status confirmed:
- Platform Version: 1.3.2
- Environment: Production with localhost:5173 development
- Database: Supabase PostgreSQL with 45+ tables
- Security Status: 42 identified issues requiring remediation
- Current Priority: Database security Phase 1 (function search_path fixes)

Please specify:
1. What specific task or feature are you looking to work on?
2. Is this related to any items in the current TODO.md priorities?
3. Do you need me to create a backup before beginning work?
4. Are there any specific constraints or requirements for this task?
```

### **Phase 3: Work Planning**
```
Based on your requirements, I will:

1. CREATE BACKUP: Following naming convention backup-[feature-name]-YYYY-MM-DD_HH-mm-ss
2. REVIEW IMPACT: Check how this affects existing functionality
3. PLAN APPROACH: Outline implementation strategy
4. EXECUTE SAFELY: Follow all security and development protocols
5. TEST THOROUGHLY: Comprehensive QA following established procedures
6. DOCUMENT CHANGES: Update relevant documentation as needed

Is this approach acceptable before I proceed?
```

## üõ°Ô∏è **CRITICAL RULES TO EMPHASIZE**

### **üö® ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS**
```
NEVER:
‚ùå Disable RLS as a "quick fix"
‚ùå Work without creating a backup first
‚ùå Modify database security settings without explicit approval
‚ùå Make changes that could break authentication
‚ùå Work on multiple unrelated features simultaneously
‚ùå Skip the mandatory QA process
‚ùå Push to production without user approval
‚ùå Give multiple instructions at once (user is new to development)
‚ùå Continue without explicit user confirmation between steps
‚ùå Assume user knowledge level or skip explanations
```

### **‚úÖ MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS**
```
ALWAYS:
‚úÖ Create backup before any significant changes
‚úÖ Follow the 5-phase database security implementation plan
‚úÖ Test all changes thoroughly before presenting
‚úÖ Consider impact on existing functionality
‚úÖ Document any new features or changes
‚úÖ Follow established naming conventions
‚úÖ Complete comprehensive QA checklist
‚úÖ Use step-by-step approach with user confirmation at each stage
‚úÖ Explain what each step does and why it's needed
‚úÖ Wait for "proceed" or "continue" before next step
‚úÖ Provide clear testing instructions for each change
```

## üí° **BEST PRACTICES**

### **Communication Tips**
- **Be specific**: Always provide concrete details and examples
- **Ask questions**: Clarify requirements before starting work
- **Set expectations**: Give realistic timelines and scope
- **Update regularly**: Don't disappear for long periods without communication
- **Document decisions**: Explain why you chose specific approaches

### **Development Tips**
- **Start small**: Make incremental changes and test frequently
- **Think integration**: Consider how changes affect the broader system
- **Test thoroughly**: QA is not optional - it's mandatory
- **Document as you go**: Don't leave documentation for the end
- **Follow patterns**: Use existing code patterns and conventions

### **Problem-Solving Tips**
- **Read error messages carefully**: Don't guess at solutions
- **Check existing solutions**: Look for similar patterns in the codebase
- **Consider alternatives**: Have backup plans if primary approach fails
- **Ask for help**: Don't struggle alone - communicate issues early
- **Learn from mistakes**: Document lessons learned for future reference

## üé¨ **SAMPLE ONBOARDING CONVERSATION**

### **How a Good Chat Should Start:**
```
USER: "I need help fixing the mobile responsiveness issues on the admin pages."

AI AGENT: "Hello! I'm here to help with the Car Audio Competition Platform development.

Before I begin any work, I need to confirm that I have read and understood all required documentation:

‚úÖ AI_DEVELOPMENT_PROTOCOL.md - Critical rules understood
‚úÖ DATABASE_SECURITY_AUDIT.md - Security constraints acknowledged  
‚úÖ BACKUP_RECOVERY_PROTOCOL.md - Backup procedures confirmed
‚úÖ IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md - Development roadmap reviewed
‚úÖ SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE_BLUEPRINT.md - System architecture understood
‚úÖ DATABASE_SCHEMA_REFERENCE.md - Database structure mapped
‚úÖ APPLICATION_PLAN.md - Platform functionality comprehended
‚úÖ TODO.md - Current priorities identified

I understand this is a production system with real users and data, and I will follow all established protocols.

Regarding your mobile responsiveness request:

Current Context Confirmed:
- Platform Version: 1.3.2
- This aligns with TODO.md priority: 'Mobile Responsiveness: Audit and fix all 42 pages for mobile compatibility'
- Admin pages affected: AdminSettings, AdminAnalytics, AdminUsers, etc.

Implementation Plan:
1. BACKUP: Create backup-mobile-responsiveness-fixes-2025-06-16_[timestamp]
2. ANALYSIS: Audit current admin pages for responsive design issues
3. APPROACH: Use CSS Grid/Flexbox and Tailwind responsive utilities
4. IMPLEMENTATION: Fix pages systematically, starting with most critical
5. TESTING: Test on multiple screen sizes and devices
6. QA: Complete mobile responsiveness checklist

Risk Assessment: LOW (CSS changes only, no functionality changes)
Files to modify: Multiple admin page components and possibly shared CSS

May I proceed with creating the backup and beginning the mobile audit?"

USER: "Yes, please proceed."

AI AGENT: "Perfect! Creating backup and beginning mobile responsiveness audit..."
