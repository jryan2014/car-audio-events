## 🛡️ Backup System Usage

### Creating Backups (ALWAYS DO THIS BEFORE CHANGES!)

```bash
# Create a backup before making any database changes
node backup-system.cjs create
```

### Listing Available Backups

```bash
# See all available backups
node backup-system.cjs list
```

### Restoring from Backup

```bash
# Restore from a specific backup file
node backup-system.cjs restore backups/backup-2025-06-11T17-35-22-319Z.sql
```

### 🔄 Recommended Workflow

1. **Before ANY database changes**:
   ```bash
   node backup-system.cjs create
   ```

2. **Make your changes**

3. **If something goes wrong**:
   ```bash
   node backup-system.cjs list
   node backup-system.cjs restore <backup-file>
   ```

---

## 🚀 Getting Started After Recovery

### 1. Access the System

- **Admin Login**: `admin@caraudioevents.com` / `admin123!`
- **Local Dev Server**: `npm run dev` (should be running on port 5178)
- **Database**: Supabase local instance on port 54322

### 2. Verify Everything Works

```bash
# Check if Supabase is running
npx supabase status

# Check if React dev server is running  
npm run dev

# Create a backup (recommended first step)
node backup-system.cjs create
```

### 3. Development Safety Rules

⚠️ **NEVER AGAIN execute these commands without explicit user consent:**
- `npx supabase db reset`
- `npx supabase db stop`  
- `docker volume rm`
- Any command that could destroy data

✅ **ALWAYS do this before risky operations:**
- `node backup-system.cjs create`
- Verify backup was successful
- Then proceed with changes

## 🔮 Future Prevention Measures

### 1. Mandatory Backup Workflow
- Always create backup before database changes
- Automatic cleanup keeps 10 most recent backups
- Both SQL and JSON formats for redundancy

### 2. Safe Development Practices
- Never run destructive commands without explicit user consent
- Always verify backup exists before risky operations
- Test changes on backed-up data first

### 3. System Monitoring
- Regular backup verification
- Database health checks
- Documentation of all changes
