BACKUP: Database Security Phase 2 - RLS Enablement
Backup created: 06/17/2025 22:36:49

=== PURPOSE ===
Enabling RLS on 5 critical tables with existing policies

=== CRITICAL TABLES ===
- advertisements (HIGH RISK)
- event_categories (HIGH RISK)
- events (HIGH RISK)
- profiles (HIGH RISK)
- users (CRITICAL RISK)

=== CURRENT STATUS ===
These tables have security policies but RLS is DISABLED
This is a MAJOR SECURITY VULNERABILITY

=== PHASE 2 APPROACH ===
1. Start with lowest risk (event_categories)
2. Progress to medium risk (advertisements, events)
3. Handle high risk (profiles)
4. Complete with critical (users)
5. Full verification and testing

=== ROLLBACK PLAN ===
Disable RLS on any table that breaks functionality
Investigate policy issues
Re-enable properly
