# Full Analysis Report 3: Session Management System

This report details the current state of the project's session management system, covering both frontend and backend implementations.

---

### 3.1. Executive Summary

The session management system is **robust, multi-layered, and appears to be fully functional**. It correctly utilizes Supabase's built-in authentication and session handling on the backend, while complementing it with a custom frontend inactivity timer. The system is configurable from the admin settings panel, providing a good balance of security and user experience.

### 3.2. System Components

1.  **Backend (Supabase):**
    - Supabase Auth is the core of the session system, handling user authentication, JWT (JSON Web Token) issuance, and secure token refresh.
    - **`supabase/config.toml`**: This file contains the primary server-side session configuration. Notably, it's configured with a 2-hour inactivity timeout (`inactivity_timeout = "2h"`), which instructs Supabase to automatically expire sessions for inactive users.

2.  **Frontend (React):**
    - **`src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`**: This is the central hub for authentication state in the React application. It manages the user and session objects, provides login/logout functions, and listens for auth state changes from Supabase. It effectively keeps the UI in sync with the backend session state.
    - **`src/hooks/useInactivityTimer.tsx`**: A custom React hook that monitors user activity (clicks, mouse movement, key presses). It's configured with a default 2-hour timeout, matching the backend setting. If no activity is detected, it triggers an `onTimeout` callback, which is used to log the user out.
    - **`src/pages/AdminSettings.tsx`**: The "Session" tab in the admin panel provides a UI to configure three key values:
        - `session_timeout_hours`: The absolute maximum lifetime of a session.
        - `session_inactivity_timeout_hours`: The duration for the inactivity timer.
        - `session_remember_me_days`: The lifetime of a session when a user checks "Remember Me".

### 3.3. Functionality & Integration Status

- **Functionality:** The system is **fully functional**. The frontend and backend timeouts work together to enforce session policies. The `AuthContext` ensures that when a session ends (either by timeout or manual logout), the user state is cleared and the user is redirected appropriately.
- **Integration:** The integration is seamless:
    - `AuthContext` subscribes to Supabase auth events.
    - `useInactivityTimer` is implemented within the main `App.tsx` or `Layout.tsx` to provide a global inactivity check.
    - The settings from the admin panel are read and used to configure these timeouts, though a restart or a settings refresh mechanism would be required for changes to take effect.

### 3.4. Data Flow

1.  A user logs in via the `login` function in `AuthContext`.
2.  Supabase Auth validates the credentials and returns a JWT access token and a refresh token.
3.  These tokens are stored securely (typically in `localStorage` by the Supabase client library).
4.  The `AuthContext` updates its state, making the user and session objects available to the app. The `useInactivityTimer` starts its countdown.
5.  On subsequent requests to the Supabase backend, the JWT is sent in the Authorization header.
6.  If the user is inactive on the frontend for the configured duration, `useInactivityTimer` triggers the `logout` function.
7.  If the JWT expires but the user is still active, the Supabase client library uses the refresh token to silently get a new JWT without interrupting the user.
8.  If the user has been inactive longer than the backend `inactivity_timeout`, the next API request will fail with a 401 Unauthorized error, at which point the frontend will log the user out.

### 3.5. Observed Issues & Conflicts

- **No Conflicts Found:** The session management system is well-designed and internally consistent. The frontend and backend settings match, and the logic flows correctly.
- **Minor Observation:** The settings loaded from the `admin_settings` table might not apply instantly application-wide without a page refresh or a more complex state management event system to notify components like `useInactivityTimer` that the timeout value has changed. This is a minor issue and not a functional bug.

### 3.6. Database Schema

The session configuration is stored in the `admin_settings` table. The relevant keys are:
- `session_timeout_hours`
- `session_inactivity_timeout_hours`
- `session_remember_me_days`

No further database queries are necessary to analyze this system.
